# SLang
_A simple text localization system for GameMaker_

### SLang is also available for download [on Itch.io](https://stoozey.itch.io/slang).

Proper localization support in your projects is crucial, if left too long using plain strings it can be a real headache to get supported. The aim of SLang is to be very plug-and-play so you can focus on making your project instead of having to deal with localization code.  

### **Why use SLang?**

-   Custom .slang file type which is very simple to read and edit
-   The .slang file includes comment support--a big advantage over using JSON
-   All .slang files are loaded automatically, meaning users can create their _own_ translations that you can easily make viewable in your project without them needing to edit official files
-   Smaller overall file size from JSON, if your project has a lot of text this can add up!
-   Automatically format variables into strings with a special operator
-   All operators can be customized to your liking
